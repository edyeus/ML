# Project 1: Navigation

### Project Details

The project is about training an agent to navigate in a large square world to collect bananas. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and action space contains 4 discrete actions. The environment is considered solved when the average score of last 100 episodes reach at or above 15.0 or an overall of 1800 episodes have passed. 

### Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need:
- Jupyter Notebook

Clone this repo and open up Navigation.ipynb as jupyter notebook.

### Instructions

To train the agent yourself:
Run through every section in the jupyter notebook.

To run the trained agent:
Run through every section except skip the 7th section, which has comment "skip the next section if you'd like to run the trained agent" right before the section.
